*Help us improve the Telerik AppBuilder CLI* 

[![Telerik AppBuilder](ab-logo.png "Telerik AppBuilder")](http://www.telerik.com/appbuilder "The Telerik AppBuilder web site")

The Telerik AppBuilder CLI lets you build, test, deploy, and publish hybrid mobile apps for iOS and Android from your favorite IDE or code editor. You can develop your projects locally from the convenience of your favorite code editor and run the command-line to test, build, deploy in the simulator or on devices, and publish your applications to App Store or Google Play.

Report an Issue

Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues. Providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* Overview of the issue - if an error is being thrown a stack trace helps
* Motivation for or Use Case - explain why this is a bug for you
* Teletik AppBuilder Version(s) - is it a regression?
* Operating System - is this a problem with all operating systems?
* Reproduce the error - provide an unambiguous set of steps.
* Related issues - has a similar issue been reported before?
* Suggest a Fix - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)
